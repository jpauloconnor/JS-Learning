//The best way to learn is to practice on your own.
//You can just about any topic and practice.

//Here are a few challenges:

//1
//Create a prototype object called fastFoodJoint.
//Give it about 4-6 properties. Give the properties default values.
//Try to create 2-3 methods for the object.

//or

//Create objects for a game. Give the object and objects special functions:
// swatWithSword, shootWithLaser 


//2
//Create two or three objects off of this prototype object.
//Set the values for each of those.

//3
// See if you can write override methods for any of those objects

//Have fun with it!


//Have the students share their repls on Slack.
