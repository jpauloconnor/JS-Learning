//every object is built by a constructor function
//Would be rith to say:
	//JS is actually more object oriented in some ways...
	//Other languages are class-oriented

//A constructor makes an object "base on" its own prototype. 
	//based on
	//says we make a copy of an object....
		//i have an instance that was a copy of a parent

//constructor makes an object linked to its own prototype
