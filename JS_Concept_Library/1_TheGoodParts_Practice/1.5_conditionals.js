//CHALLENGE/WORK TIME: WRITE YOUR OWN CONDITIONAL WITH SOME KIND OF 
// STORY OR THEME LIKE THE ONE ABOVE


//Challenge:
//Set up a var with bankAccount and a var with debt.
//Also set up a difference var.
//Do some logic to show whether or not you will pay off your debt or prints out a message if you have extra money.
